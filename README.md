DevOps enhances the process of delivering software by merging development and operations into one process. Peters (2024) says that it eliminates the silos that are common in traditional development by organizing different groups to achieve similar goals, such as increased speed and reliability of systems. This makes it easy to address any problem that may have been overlooked earlier.

One area in which DevOps improves delivery through automation. According to Peters (2024), automation through CI/CD, among other DevOps practices, optimises processes related to testing, building, and the deployment process, which results in less error compared to other processes. Through DevOps, organisations are able to respond faster to the needs of the customers.

DevOps also enhances software delivery. For instance, continuous monitoring and feedback are included in software delivery by DevOps. Real-time performance data is gathered for monitoring and feedback. Failures are identified, and improvements are made by monitoring and feedback. According to Peters (2024), continuous improvement and learning are achieved by feedback, and as a result, resilient and reliable software is created. DevOps therefore enhances software delivery by integrating culture, automation, and feedback.
